        Added infrastructure for altVDB and VDBmetadata options
        Handled interactions between altVDB and internal database commands
        Added General script for getting best result from top when virus group metadata is available
        If Metadata for the database is provided, virus groups from the database are used
            and mappings between accessions and viruses are used
        System file for default supported viruses created
        virus_names in src directory now contains the viruses used in the analysis

        Added Minimum Similarity Length threshold	
Version 1.3.1
	Calling --install can no longer be thwarted by dependencies not being installed
Version 1.4.0
        Major changes to Alignments
            Output bam files now only contain entries for molecules which had at least one mapped read
            Deduplication now removes supplementary and secondary alignments for duplicates
            New Statistics report to show the composition of the QC'd library made up by a reference
                and the duplication rate
            Refactoring code to reduce redundancy
Version 1.4.1
	Minor code reorganization for maintainability
Version 1.4.2
	Removed un-necessary copy of input data step
Version 1.4.3
	Added cleanup for trimmed copies of input data
Version 1.4.4
	Minor code maintainability changes
Version 1.4.5
	Removed unnecessary copy step
Version 1.5.0
        Major Changes to Read Preprocessing
            Switch to FastP as the preprocessor
            PolyG tail removal is now a default part of the pipeline
            Preprocessed Reads are now retained in an output directory TRACES_preprocessed_reads
Version 1.5.1
	Updates to help for clarity
Version 1.5.2
	Fix Bug where specific alignments were not moved correctly
Version 1.6.0
	Added compilation of alignment stats into a report which can be run after the fact if required --compile-aln-stats
Version 1.6.1
	Fixed Bug where TRACES_compile_stats.sh all did nothing
Version 1.6.2
	Fixed bug where mito and cy stats compiling missed some files
Version 1.6.3
	Bug fix for calculating depths on specific alignments
Version 1.6.4
	Fixed bug leading to extraneous error message
Version 1.6.5
	Disabled error correction for spades, to save on time and memory usage
Version 1.6.6
	Refactor for coding standards and brevity
Version 1.7.0
        Refactor of get best scripts to allow running run-all-v-alig without meta if meta was run previously
Version 1.7.1
        Cleanup and storage of vcf index files after consensus calling
Version 1.8.0
        New option to specify the maximum number of alignments to report for any read
         The goal is to reduce file size and memory consumption for viruses with high abundance repeats
         Specifically HHV-7 and its telomeric repeats
        Default value set to 10 alignments
Version 1.9.0
        New flag, --attempt-resume-denovo, which signals that a partial denovo assembly run may be present
         TRACESPipe will have meta-spades attempt to resume from a checkpoint, and if this fails
         meta-spades will restart from scratch
Version 1.9.1
	Fixed Bug where top files in the results were checked before being made present
Version 1.10.0
	New Analysis Option min-sim-viral allows user to provide a tab delim file with virus specific minimum similarity thresholds
Version 1.10.1
	Included FastP in TRACESPipe Update
